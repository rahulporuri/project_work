Inflation and Bouncing universe.
====

The theory of Inflation was proposed to solve the shortcomings of the hot big bang model of the universe, namely the horizon problem and the flatness problem to name two. Inflation refers to a epoch during the early stages of the radiation-dominated universe when the universe expanded exponentially. On the other hand, in a Bouncing model of the universe, there is no hot big bang. Instead, the universe contracts to a critical value and then starts expanding outwards again.

This repository contains my thesis work (2), primarily code and results pertaining to the the signature of two models of inflation, namely power law inflation and inflation driven by small field potential model and a bouncing universe (matter bounce).

The dirs *power_law*, *small_field* and *matter_bounce* contain the relevant code and results. The dir *mini_thesis* is one of my thesis reports for my project work on the evolution of tensor perturbations during the aforementioned models of inflation and the tensor power spectrum at super-Hubble scales.

The dirs *power_law* also contains code pertaining to the tensor bi-spectrum and the non-gaussianity parameter h_NL. Codes are in C and python and the results obtained from them are compared with results from a mathematica code.
