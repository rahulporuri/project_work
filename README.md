Inflation and Bouncing universe.
====

The theory of Inflation was proposed to solve the shortcomings of 
the hot big bang model of the universe, namely the horizon problem 
and the flatness problem to name two. Inflation refers to a epoch 
during the early stages of the radiation-dominated universe when 
the universe expanded exponentially. On the other hand, in a Bouncing 
model of the universe, there is no hot big bang. Instead, the universe 
contracts to a critical value and then starts expanding outwards again.

This repository contains my thesis work, primarily code and results 
pertaining to the the signature of two models of inflation, namely 
power law inflation and inflation driven by small field potential model 
and a bouncing universe. The dirs *power_law*, *small_field* and 
*bouncing_model* contain the relevant code and results. The dir 
*mini_thesis* is a thesis report for my project work on the 
evolution of tensor perturbations during the aforementioned models 
of inflation and the tensor power spectrum at super-Hubble scales.
