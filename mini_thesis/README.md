This repository contains a thesis for my project work 
on the evolution of tensor perturbations during two models of 
inflation, namely power law inflation and inflation driven by 
a small field potential model. It's sister dirs *power_law* and 
*small_field* contain the code and results mentioned in this 
thesis.
