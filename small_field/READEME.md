For inflation driven by a small field potential model of the form

$$ V(\phi) = V_0[1-(\frac{\phi}{\mu})^p]$$

we solve the equations governing the evolution of the scalar field 
driving inflation. Using these solutions, we solve the evolution of 
tensor perturbations.

The equations governing the evolution of the scalar field and the 
tensor perturbations are

$$\phi$$

$$h_k$$

where ' refers to differentiation with respect to conformal time $\eta$.

It is easier to numerically solve the above differential equations 
if we write it in terms of e-fold N.
